h1. _In progress_

h2. What is a collection?

p. Backbone collections are simply an ordered set of "models":/what-is-a-model.   Such that it can be used in situations such as;

* Model: Student, Collection: ClassStudents 
* Model: Todo Item, Collection: Todo List
* Model: Animals, Collection: Zoo

Typically your collection will only use one type of model but models themselves are not limited to a type of collection;

* Model: Student, Collection: Gym Class
* Model: Student, Collection: Art Class
* Model: Student, Collection: English Class

Here is a generic Model/Collection example.

{% highlight javascript %}

    var Song = Backbone.Model.extend({
        initialize: function(){
            console.log("Music is the answer");
        }
    });
    
    var Album = Backbone.Collection.extend({
		model: Song
	});

{% endhighlight %}

h3. Building a collection

p. Now we are going to populate a creation with some useful data.

{% highlight javascript %}

    var Song = Backbone.Model.extend({
		defaults: {
			name: "Not specified",
			artist: "Not specified"
		},
        initialize: function(){
            console.log("Music is the answer");
        }
    });
    
    var Album = Backbone.Collection.extend({
		model: Song
	});
	
	var song1 = new Song({ name: "How Bizarre", artist: "OMC" });
	var song2 = new Song({ name: "Sexual Healing", artist: "Marvin Gaye" });
	var song3 = new Song({ name: "Talk It Over In Bed", artist: "OMC" });
	
	var myAlbum = new Album([ song1, song2, song3]);
	console.log( myAlbum.models ); // [song1, song2, song3]
	
{% endhighlight %}
