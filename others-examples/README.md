# Backbone Tutorials

This site is by no means the definite guide to backbone.js and all corrections and contributions are welcome.
About Backbone Tutorials

As single page apps and large scale javascript applications become more prominent on the web, useful resources for those developers who are jumping the ship are crucial

I started this site to not only consolidate my understanding of backbone.js but to also document what I have learned thus far for myself and others.
